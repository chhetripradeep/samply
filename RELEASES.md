## Unreleased - ReleaseDate

## 0.12.0 - 2024-04-16

### Breaking changes

 - The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.74.
 - `samply load perf.data` is now called `samply import perf.data`.
 - The `--port` alias has changed from `-p` to `-P`.

### Features

 - Linux: Allow attaching to running processes with `samply record -p [pid]` ([#18](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/18), by @ishitatsuyuki)
 - Linux, macOS: Support Jitdump in `samply record`.
 - Linux: Support Jitdump in `samply import perf.data` without `perf inject --jit`.
 - Linux, macOS: Support `/tmp/perf-[pid].map`([#34](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/34) + [#36](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/36), by @bnjbvr)
 - Linux, macOS: Support specifying environment variables after `samply record`.
 - Linux, macOS: Add `--iteration-count` and`--reuse-threads` flags to `samply record`.
 - Linux: Support symbolication with `.dwo` and `.dwp` files.
 - Linux: Support unwinding and symbolicating VDSO frames.
 - Linux, macOS: Support overwriting the launched browser with `$BROWSER` ([#50](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/50), by @ishitatsuyuki)
 - Linux, macOS: Add `--profile-name` argument to `samply record` and `samply import` to allow overriding the profile name ([#68](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/68), by @rukai)
 - Linux, macOS: Support Scala Native demangling ([#109](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/109), by @keynmol)
 - macOS: Support `--main-thread-only` in `samply record`, for lower-overhead sampling
 - macOS, Linux: Unstable support for adding markers from `marker-[pid].txt` files which are opened (and, on Linux, mmap'ed) during profiling.
 - Linux: Support kernel symbols when importing `perf.data` files with kernel stacks, if `/proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict` is `0`.
 - Android: Support importing `perf.data` files recorded with simpleperf's `--trace-offcpu` flag.

### In progress

 - Linux: Groundwork to support profiling Wine apps (by @ishitatsuyuki)

### Fixes

 - Linux, macOS: Don't discard information from processes with reused process IDs (e.g. due to exec).
 - Linux: Support recording on more types of machines, by falling back to software perf events in more cases. ([#70](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/70), by @rkd-msw)
 - Linux: Fix out-of-order samples. ([#30](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/30) + [#62](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/62), by @ishitatsuyuki)
 - Linux: Fix unwinding and symbolicating in processes which have forked without exec.
 - Linux: Capture startup work of launched processes more reliably.
 - Linux: Fix debuglink symbolication in certain cases. ([#38](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/38), by @zecakeh)
 - Linux: Fix stackwalking if unwinding information is stored in compressed `.debug_frame` sections. ([#10](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/10), by @bobrik)
 - macOS: Fix symbolication of system libraries on x86_64 macOS 13+.
 - Android: Allow building samply for Android. ([#76](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/76), by @flxo)
 - macOS: Fix Jitdump symbolication for functions which were JITted just before the sample was taken ([#128](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/128), by @vvuk)
 - macOS, Linux: More reliable handling of Ctrl+C during profiling.
 - macOS: Support recording workloads with deep recursion by eliding the middle of long stacks and not running out of memory.
 - x86_64: Improve disassembly of relative jumps by displaying the absolute target address ([#54](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/54), by @jrmuizel)
 - macOS: Use yellow instead of blue, for consistency with Linux which uses yellow for user stacks and orange for kernel stacks.

### Other

 - Improve build times by using the separate serde-derive crate ([#65](https://github.com/mstange/samply/pull/65), by @CryZe)
